# ☁️ AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)

## 🚀 Overview
Amazon S3 is a highly scalable, durable, and secure object storage service used to store and retrieve any amount of data. It's commonly used for data lakes, backup, static website hosting, and more.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Data is stored as **objects** in **buckets**
- Each object has metadata and a unique key
- Access is controlled via IAM roles, bucket policies, or ACLs

## 🔧 Setup & Usage
- Create a bucket via the console or CLI:
```bash
aws s3 mb s3://my-bucket-name
```
- Upload data:
```bash
aws s3 cp myfile.csv s3://my-bucket-name/
```
- Access public or private URLs
- Integrate with services like Athena, Lambda, Glue

## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases
- Data lake storage
- Hosting ML datasets
- Logs, backups, and image storage

## 🧠 Interview Questions & Answers

### ❓ Q1: How is S3 different from EBS or EFS?
**Answer**: S3 is object-based storage (HTTP-accessible), while EBS and EFS are block and file storage for EC2 instances.

### ❓ Q2: How do you secure an S3 bucket?
**Answer**: Use bucket policies, IAM roles, and enable encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). Avoid public access unless required.

### ❓ Q3: How does versioning work?
**Answer**: S3 supports object versioning. Enabling it keeps previous versions of an object when overwritten or deleted.
