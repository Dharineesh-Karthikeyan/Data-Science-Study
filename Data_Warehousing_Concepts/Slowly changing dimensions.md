Slowly changing dimensions (SCDs) are techniques used in data warehousing to manage changes to dimension data over time. There are several types of SCDs, each with a different approach to handling historical data and updates: 
Type 0 (fixed), Type 1 (overwrite), Type 2 (row versioning), Type 3 (previous value column), Type 4 (separate history table), and Type 6 (hybrid). 


Types of Slowly Changing Dimensions:
- Type 0: This type assumes that the dimension data never changes. It's suitable for attributes that are static or have infrequent updates, such as states or zip codes. 
- Type 1: This type overwrites the existing record with the new data when a change occurs. No historical data is retained, and only the current value is stored. This is suitable when only the latest data is needed for reporting and analysis. 
- Type 2: This type maintains historical data by adding a new row for each change, while the old record remains in the table with an indication of its validity period (e.g., effective date and end date). This is useful for scenarios where it's important to track all historical changes. 
- Type 3: This type adds a new column to store the previous value of the attribute when it changes, allowing you to track the two most recent changes. This is useful when you need to compare the current and immediately preceding values, such as when a department reorganizes its sales territories. 
- Type 4: This type uses two separate tables: one for the current value and another for the historical data. When a change occurs, a new record is added to the history table, and the current table is updated. This is useful for scenarios where you need to maintain a complete audit trail of all changes. 
- Type 6: This type is a hybrid approach that combines elements of Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3. It often includes a combination of overwriting, row versioning, and previous value columns to cater to specific reporting needs.
